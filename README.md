## Introduction

### For users

This application develops on Material Design guidance. It provides a beautiful and friendly UI. Maybe it's the most beautiful doujinshi client.

**NHBooks uses NHentai.net's API. The sites may contain NSFW contents. Please pay attention to whether it is applicable to local laws and regulations.**

### For developers

Since NHBooks 2.0, we make a refactor for it. Now it uses Kotlin + Android Databinding + Room + MVVM Structure.

BTW, We try using Kotlin coroutine instead of popular async handle library (like RxJava, AsyncTask). Although it's a experimental function, it works fine.
